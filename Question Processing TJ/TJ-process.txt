  Task:
    v Synonyms:
      x using webRequeset to Dictionary.com (c#)
        x takes too much time: 1~2s/word.
      x using API (c#)
        x limited function call.
        x limited word coverage
        x less feature compare to Dictionary.com
      v "downloading" dictionary from Dictionary.com (c#)
        v no significant time cost
        v almost full coverage on English
        v can be optimized or updated
        v many features (synonyms, related words, part of speech, antonym, highligtes commons, informals)
        * should keep updating
        * should return all part of speech
        * should update a new word
	- only returns common synonyms (otherwise too much) so there is some words don't have synonyms at all

    v Part of Speech (c++)
      v "downloading" dictionary fro Dictionary.com
      - there are more than one part of speech in one word

    v Paraphrasing
      v using Microsoft Translating API (c#)
        v paraphrasing by translating English to English
        v can specify the number of paraphrases need
        - takes couple of seconds
	- cannot change the question to declarative sentence (need too much dictionary, grammar, idiom, database...etc)
	  might can be done as we work on matching part. Actually, it is not really necessary because we need to
          match the sentences anyway. Why rearrange the sentences? If we really need to search by sentence, we can just
	  use part of it rather rearranging.

* need to be fixed
